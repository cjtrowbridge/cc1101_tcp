## What CC1101 is (high-level)

CC1101 is a low-power, sub‑1 GHz RF transceiver IC. Internally it combines:

* **A low‑IF receiver chain** (LNA → quadrature down‑conversion → ADCs → digital filtering/AGC/demod).
* **A transmitter** that uses direct RF synthesis (frequency synthesizer/VCO → modulator → PA) to generate the RF output.
* **A digital baseband** that handles packet framing, buffering (TX/RX FIFOs), and optional FEC/interleaving.
* **A 4‑wire SPI interface** for configuration and data.

## 4.7 Analog Temperature Sensor

The datasheet includes an on‑chip analog temperature sensor. Key points:

* To use it (in **IDLE** state), you must write **0xBF to the PTEST register**.
* At **VDD = 3.0 V**, typical outputs are approximately:

  * **–40°C:** 0.651 V
  * **0°C:** 0.747 V
  * **+40°C:** 0.847 V
  * **+80°C:** 0.945 V
* Typical slope is **~2.45 mV/°C** (fitted over roughly –20°C to +80°C).
* There’s a calibration note: after **1‑point calibration at room temp**, the computed temperature error is typically within a few °C over that range.
* Enabling the sensor increases current consumption by about **0.3 mA**.

## 4.8 DC Characteristics (Digital I/O)

At nominal conditions (Tc ≈ 25°C):

* Logic‑0 input: **0 → 0.7 V**
* Logic‑1 input: **VDD–0.7 → VDD**
* Logic‑0 output: up to **0.5 V** (at up to ~4 mA)
* Logic‑1 output: down to **VDD–0.3 V** (at up to ~4 mA)
* Input currents are on the order of **tens of nA** at rails.

---

## 4.9 Power‑On Reset (POR)

Proper POR is guaranteed when supply behavior meets minimum constraints, otherwise you should treat the chip as unknown until you issue an **SRES** strobe via SPI.

Representative requirements:

* **Ramp‑up time:** on the order of **milliseconds** (from 0V to ~1.8V)
* **Power‑off time:** **≥ 1 ms** between power cycles

## 5 Pin Configuration

### Figure 1 — Pinout Top View (Explanation)

The figure is a **top‑view footprint map** of the 20‑pin package (plus exposed pad). It shows:

* **Digital SPI pins:** SCLK, SI, SO (also usable as GDO1 when CSn high), CSn.
* **General Digital Outputs (GDOs):** GDO0 / GDO2 (multiplexable to status, test signals, serial data, clock out, etc.).
* **Power pins:** AVDD (multiple), DVDD, DCOUPL (internal regulator decoupling output), DGUARD.
* **RF pins:** RF_P and RF_N (differential RF I/O).
* **Crystal pins:** XOSC_Q1, XOSC_Q2.
* **Bias reference:** RBIAS.
* **Ground pins:** multiple grounds plus an **exposed die attach pad**.

**Critical mechanical/electrical note:** the exposed pad is the main ground connection and should connect to a solid ground plane.

### Pinout overview (selected interpretations)

* **DCOUPL** is *only* for CC1101 decoupling; don’t use it to power other devices.
* **RF_P/RF_N** are a **differential RF port**; most end products convert it to single‑ended 50 Ω via a balun/matching network.

## 6 Circuit Description

### Figure 2 — Simplified Block Diagram (Explanation)

The figure is a **functional block diagram** of the chip. It depicts:

* **Receiver path:** RF_P/RF_N → **LNA** → quadrature mixers → **IF** → **two ADCs** (I and Q) → digital AGC / filtering / demod / bit sync.
* **Transmitter path:** digital baseband → **modulator** → RF frequency synthesis → **PA**.
* **Frequency Synthesizer:** on‑chip LC VCO + phase shifter to generate quadrature LO for RX.
* **Reference clocking:** external crystal on XOSC_Q1/Q2 provides the reference for the synthesizer + clocks for digital/ADC.
* **Packet / FIFO subsystems:** packet handler + RXFIFO/TXFIFO
* **Digital interface to MCU:** the SPI and control logic.

Interpretation: this diagram explains how CC1101 offloads “radio chores” (channelization, packet framing, buffering) from the MCU.

## 7 Application Circuit

CC1101 needs only a small set of external components, but RF layout and values matter.

### Key external component roles (paraphrased)

* **RBIAS resistor** sets a stable bias current reference.
* **Balun + RF matching** converts **differential RF** to **single‑ended**, while also transforming impedance to match 50 Ω.
* **Crystal + load capacitors** set the reference clock.
* **Optional external filtering** (e.g., SAW) can improve performance for specific regulatory or interference environments.
* **Power decoupling** must be placed close to supply pins; reference layouts are strongly recommended.

### Figure 3 — Typical Application & Evaluation Circuit (315/433 MHz) (Explanation)

This is a **reference schematic** showing CC1101 wired to:

* A **digital interface header** (SPI + optional GDO pins),
* A **crystal network** (XTAL + two load caps),
* A **bias resistor** (RBIAS),
* An **RF front end** between RF_P/RF_N and the antenna consisting of:

  * a **balun/matching network** (inductors + capacitors),
  * DC blocking where needed,
  * optional LC filtering.

The drawing omits the supply decoupling capacitors (intentionally), but it labels the pins and the “antenna 50 Ω” connection point.

### Figure 4 — Typical Application & Evaluation Circuit (868/915 MHz) (Explanation)

Functionally identical to Figure 3 (digital interface + crystal + bias + RF network), but the **component values/topology** differ for the higher band.

## 9 Configuration Software

The document recommends using **SmartRF Studio** to:

* generate optimized register settings,
* evaluate performance,
* explore features (modulation choices, packet settings, etc.).

### Figure 6 — SmartRF Studio UI (Explanation)

This figure is a screenshot of the SmartRF Studio application. It’s included to show:

* where you select the CC1101 device,
* where modulation / frequency / packet parameters are configured,
* where register values are presented.

Practical meaning: it’s a workflow hint—use the tool to avoid hand‑tuning dozens of registers.

## 10 4‑Wire Serial Configuration and Data Interface (SPI)

The SPI interface (SI, SO, SCLK, CSn):

* Uses a header byte with:

  * a **R/W bit**,
  * a **burst bit**,
  * a **6‑bit address**.
* Requires CSn to stay low for the duration of a transaction; if CSn goes high mid‑transfer, the operation is cancelled.
* Requires the MCU to wait for SO to go low (chip ready / crystal running) before clocking.

### Figure 7 — Register Read/Write Operation Timing (Explanation)

This figure shows the **wire‑level timing** of SPI transfers:

* CSn goes low to start.
* The master clocks out a header/address byte.
* Data bytes follow (single or burst).
* The chip outputs a status byte on SO aligned with the transfer.

The figure is paired with the timing table (setup/hold and min clock high/low times).

### Chip Status Byte (conceptual transcription)

When you send a header/data/strobe, CC1101 returns a **status byte** containing:

* **CHIP_RDYn** (bit 7): indicates crystal/power stabilized.
* **STATE** bits: coarse operational state (IDLE, RX, TX, etc.).
* **FIFO_BYTES_AVAILABLE**: for reads, how many bytes in RX FIFO; for writes, how much space in TX FIFO (with “15” meaning 15+).

## 19 Radio Control / State Machine

CC1101 includes a built‑in state machine that transitions between modes via:

* explicit **command strobes** (e.g., SRX, STX, SIDLE), and
* internal events (e.g., FIFO underflow/overflow).

### Figure 5 — Simplified State Diagram w/ Typical Current Consumption (Explanation)

This illustration is a **simplified flowchart** of the main operating states (Sleep, XOFF, IDLE, RX, TX, and several transitional states like frequency‑synth startup and calibration).

It annotates each state with **typical current consumption** under an example configuration. Key takeaways:

* **IDLE** is the default “radio awake but not doing RF” state (~mA scale).
* **Sleep** is the lowest power state (sub‑µA scale), with an option for **WOR** (wake‑on‑radio) at slightly higher current.
* **XOFF** retains registers at a moderate current compared to Sleep.
* **TX** current depends heavily on configured output power (values are given for several output levels).
* **RX** current varies slightly based on input strength (AGC behavior).

The arrows show the strobes/events that move between states (e.g., STX triggers TX entry; SRX triggers RX entry; SFRX/SFTX flush FIFOs; SCAL runs manual calibration).

### Figure 16 — Complete Radio Control State Diagram (Explanation)

This is the full version of the state machine. Compared to Figure 5 it:

* breaks “RX/TX settling” into more detailed substates,
* explicitly shows overflow/underflow recovery paths,
* labels each state with a numeric ID that maps to the MARCSTATE status register.

Practical meaning: it’s the definitive map for debugging “why is the radio stuck?” situations.

## 15 Matrix Interleaving (FEC support)

### Figure 15 — Principle of Matrix Interleaving (Explanation)

This figure depicts **two 4×4 matrices** (conceptually) used for interleaving/de‑interleaving when FEC/interleaving is enabled:

* In TX:

  * coded bits are written row‑wise into a matrix,
  * transmitted column‑wise.
* In RX:

  * received symbols are written column‑wise,
  * read out row‑wise before decoding.

The figure also connects the interleaver between the packet engine and the modulator/demodulator blocks.

Implications noted in the text:

* You need **trellis termination** (extra byte(s)).
* Over‑the‑air transmitted payload must be a multiple of the interleaver chunk (the hardware may insert 1–2 invisible bytes).
* Minimum payload becomes **2 bytes** when this mode is enabled.

## FIFO thresholds and GDO signaling

The datasheet explains how FIFO threshold signals can be routed to GDO pins.

### Figure 20 — FIFO threshold vs. number of bytes in FIFO (Explanation)

This figure is a small timing sketch that correlates:

* **NUM_RXBYTES** / **NUM_TXBYTES** values (bytes in FIFO)
* to the **GDO signal** changing state,

for an example threshold configuration (FIFO_THR=13). It illustrates the hysteresis-like behavior as the FIFO fills above and drains below the threshold.

### Figure 21 — Example of FIFOs at threshold (Explanation)

This figure is a conceptual diagram showing:

* how the RX FIFO and TX FIFO thresholds provide **overflow margin** and **underflow margin**,
* at a specific threshold setting (example shown for FIFO_THR=13),
* and where the “assert point” lies relative to FIFO depth.

---

## 21 Frequency Programming (conceptual transcription)

The frequency system supports channelized operation:

* Program **channel spacing** via mantissa/exponent registers (CHANSPC_M / CHANSPC_E).
* Program a base/start frequency using a 24‑bit frequency word split across FREQ2/FREQ1/FREQ0.
* Select channel numbers with CHANNR, which offsets by the configured spacing.

The datasheet notes a max channel spacing on the order of a few hundred kHz with a 26 MHz crystal, and suggests skipping channels if you want “effective spacing” like 1 MHz.
